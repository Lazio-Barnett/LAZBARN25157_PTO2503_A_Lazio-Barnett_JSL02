📌 JSL02 – Task Input & Status Tracker
🚀 What’s Going On Here
This project takes the Kanban board setup from JSL01 and gives it some life with JavaScript.
You’ll add two tasks, the script will check their status, and the console will show which ones are done (or tell you to get moving if none are finished).

✨ What It Can Do
Ask for a title, description, and status for two tasks

Automatically changes whatever you type for status into lowercase

Won’t accept anything except todo, doing, or done (keeps asking until you get it right)

Shows all tasks marked as “done” in the console

Gives a motivational nudge if no tasks are done yet

Clean, easy-to-read code with comments
